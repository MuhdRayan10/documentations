# Documentation

Welcome! This document will guide you through all the features offered by <https://allraise.rayantech.me> and show you how to make the most of them.

## Airtable Connectivity

The web scraper is connected to the following [Airtable](https://airtable.com/appdE7NI8QaJZ8KN4/), which contains two tables:

1.  **Conference List:** This table holds the list of conferences you want the scraper to process. Simply add all the conferences you wish to include here.
2.  **Results:** This table stores the list of conferences that the web scraper finds, along with their corresponding details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Modes

You can explore VC conference data on the internet using three main modes:

1.  **Airtable Sync Mode**
2.  **Manual Search Mode**
3.  **Discovery Mode**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Airtable Sync Mode

This mode retrieves conference entries from the configured Airtable table, searches for updated details, and writes the results back to the destination table.

You can select specific conferences from the list to search for
recurring events.

Once the search is complete, the updated results are automatically written to the **Results** table in Airtable, as shown below:

Additionally, you can export or download the collected data as a **PDF** file or **Excel sheet** for offline use.

### Discovery Mode

If you've already explored your existing list of conferences and want to discover new opportunities beyond your current set, **Discovery Mode** helps you find fresh conferences from across the web.

The results from this mode are also saved to the same **Results** table in Airtable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Manual Search Mode

When you need to search for a single conference independently, **Manual Search Mode** is your go-to option. The search results are displayed directly on the website rather than being saved to Airtable.
